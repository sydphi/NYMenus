This repo contains R source for exploring the Historical NY Menu database hosted by the NY Public library at: http://menus.nypl.org/.

I discovered that this existed in a recent "Data is Plural" post from Jeremy Singer-Vine:  http://menus.nypl.org/.  Thanks Jeremy! Jeremy's Google Doc Archive can be found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0
